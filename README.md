### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I'm a student in Lodz Tech University(Studyin' computer science)**

- I love programming in all shapes or forms(except maybe frontend) and I'm very fond of engineering as a process
- I'm particularly good at C-like languages, be it C itself, C++ or even C#
- I primarily use GitHub to store and publish my projects, so take a look around
